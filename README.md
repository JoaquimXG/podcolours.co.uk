# POD Colours
POD Colours is a unique personality evaluation test. 
The POD Colours tool supports individuals and teams to appreciate differences in personality by en- hancing self-awareness, leading to a deeper understanding of oneself and other people.
The POD Colours tool is based on psychological research, and provides an indication of your key strengths and potential barriers to success.

Serves as the landing page for the site. Functionality includes; 'Login' button to promt user input (Email address and Password), 'Take the test' button to direct user to app.html and begin the personality test. Also includes general information about POD Colours.

## app.html
Allows the user to drag and drop personality statement cards into either a red or green 'dropzone'. Once all the cards on screen have been dragged into the appropriate section a new set of cards will appear. This process will be repeated until all the cards have been sorted into sections. 
At the end of the test the user will be greeted with a pop up that states which colour they have been grouped into. The text indicating what colour they are will change automatically and display some brief information on their type of personality result. They will also have the option to 'suggest a movie'. This function will incorporate the use of the IMDB movie database to search for relative genres that are based on the personality result.
